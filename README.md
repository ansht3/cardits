# 🌿 Cardits — Carbon Credit Infrastructure on Blockchain

## 🚀 Mission
Carbon markets run on trust without verification — Cardits fixes that.  
A blockchain platform for issuing, verifying, and trading carbon credits with transparency.  
Sustainability should scale as fast as innovation — and trust should be built into every transaction.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The carbon credit process is slow, opaque, and unaccountable.  
Manual audits, double-counted credits, and inaccessible marketplaces stall real decarbonization.

---

## ✅ Solution
Cardits provides an on-chain carbon credit lifecycle:  
1. Companies submit emissions reports  
2. Auditors verify via DAO voting  
3. Regulators mint verified credits  
4. Credits trade transparently on a blockchain marketplace  

No intermediaries. No silent edits. Full provenance.

## 🧠 System Architecture
**Flow:**  
Company → Report → DAO Verification → Mint Credits → Marketplace → Public Ledger  
All state changes are on-chain and queryable for public audit.

---

## 🧩 Smart Contract Design
- **Ownership:** Manages privileged roles (e.g., regulator).  
- **Voting:** DAO verifies emission reports.  
- **Auction:** Trustless bidding and transfer of verified credits.  

Together they enable permissioned authority, verifiable validation, and decentralized trading.

---

## 💻 Frontend / User Experience
- **Dashboard:** Tracks credits, emissions, and compliance status  
- **Analytics:** Line graphs + verification progress indicators  
- **Marketplace:** View, bid, and purchase verified credits  
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask + Ethers.js support  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** React, Material UI, React Router, Ethers.js  
**Smart Contracts:** Solidity (0.8.x), Hardhat, Remix, Ethereum Testnets (Sepolia/Goerli)  
**Storage:** On-chain reads + IPFS (planned) for audit docs  

---

## 🔐 Governance Model
- **Regulator:** Issues credits through permissioned minting  
- **Auditor DAO:** Votes on emission validity  
- **Companies:** Submit data; cannot self-approve  

All decisions and approvals are visible on-chain.

---

## ✅ MVP Features
- DAO-based emissions verification  
- On-chain role control  
- Carbon credit auction contract  
- React dashboard + wallet integration  
- Report upload + verification status UI  

---

## 🔭 Future Integrations
- ERC-1155 tokenized credits  
- IPFS decentralized storage  
- AI anomaly detection for fraud  
- Fractional credit trading  
- Multi-chain registry bridges
